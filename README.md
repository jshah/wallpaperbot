# Wallpaperbot

This bot will run every day and download the url of any post which has over 1000 karma on /r/wallpapers

# General Info

This is a project I'm doing for fun since I like collecting wallpapers. It's still under construction and I will be working it as I have time. If you have any questions, shoot me an email at contactjay@gmail.com

# Usage

1) Clone this repo
2) Make a Script App on Reddit by following this: https://github.com/reddit/reddit/wiki/OAuth2
3) Replace redditID, redditSecret & redditPassword in config.properties.example with your app id, app secret, and your reddit user's password
4) Rename config.properties.example to config.properties
5) Then run by typing "./run"
6) Wallpapers should be downloads into a folder called files in the root folder
7) You can clean the directory by running "./clean"
